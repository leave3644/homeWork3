2nd week iOS design class homework

  How many hours did it take to complete? 
    About 11 hours
  Which required and optional stories have you completed?
    I did:
        Facebook login page
          Tapping in the UITextField repositions the elements, as shown in the screenshots.
          Tapping anywhere dismisses the keyboard (try to do that, but failed) 
          If email and password field are both blank, button should be disabled.
          After tapping log in button, show the loading indicator in the button. After a 2 second delay, check the password.
          If the password is 'password', transition to the next screen.
          If the password is anything else, display the password error alert.
        Facebook feed
          Immediately after launch, display the loading indicator.
          After 2 seconds, show the feed, which is a long image in a scrollable view.
